# this is a working ecommerce site created with php. 
I created a working login/create account page. which can be accessed by clicking "sign in" in the top right.
Once logged in the index page will now display the created username replacing the "sign-in" button and will aslo display a basket beside it.  
The index page dispalays items which can be added to the basket page by clicking "add to basket".
the basket page disaplys all added items by the user and also offers a "remove from basket" button
